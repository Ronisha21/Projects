# Projects
This project is a webpage I created using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript following the 
'2020 Frontend Developer Crash Course for Absolute Beginners' by the DesignCourse 
on YouTube. Through the project I learned about numerous HTML and CSS properties 
including mobile-first development, media queries, font-families, flex and grid, 
through the use of Adobe XD and Visual Studio Code.
The creator of DesignCourse created the webpage design that resulted from this course,
and I learned and apply the concepts from the tutorial to build the website on my end as
well.
